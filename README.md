# OpenCV_Tut

This task is based on the tutorial available at ["LEARN OPENCV C++ in 4 HOURS | Including 3x Projects | Computer Vision"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FYm3GOonhk).

## Task Functions

The following task functions are implemented in this project:

- `detect_faces()`: This function uses OpenCV to detect faces in an input image or video stream.
- `detect_shapes()`: This function uses OpenCV to detect shapes in an input image or video stream.
- `draw()`: This function uses OpenCV to draw shapes on an input image.
- `filter()`: This function uses OpenCV to apply various filters to an input image or video stream.
- `create_gui()`: This function creates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using OpenCV to allow for user interaction with an input image or video stream.
- `resize_crop()`: This function uses OpenCV to resize and crop an input image.
- `read_img()`: This function reads an image from a specified file path using OpenCV.
- `read_video()`: This function reads a video from a specified file path using OpenCV.
- `warp()`: This function uses OpenCV to perform a perspective warp on an input image.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the desired task function from the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. Make sure to have OpenCV installed on your system.
